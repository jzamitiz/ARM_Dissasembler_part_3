To run this file on Linux, type in the following into the command line:

$ python3 team9_project3.py -i test3a_bin.txt -o team9_out

The result should state the raw output file name "team9_out" and two new output text file will be created with the
proper disassembler output and the simulator output:

team9_out_dis.txt for disassembler

The simulator does not output anything because our team was not able to complete the task.
